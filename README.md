# First-Python-Project
Python Trivia Game

This is my first project using python. Currently only works on MacOsx

To get started make sure you have python installed on your machince

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/

Then you'll need to upgrade your pip - This alows you to install your packages in python3

  -pip3 install -U pip

Once you have that Installed Go-ahead and fork this repository

  -CD into my_project

run this command which will activate our vitual environment

  -source my_project/bin/activate

After the Virtual Environment has been activated you can start the game by running this command

  -python Trivia.py

And Have Fun
